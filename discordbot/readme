# Discord Announcement Bot - MapleCore 🤖

Automatically posts your MySQL database announcements to Discord. Perfect for game servers!

## What it does
- Checks your database every 30 seconds
- Posts new announcements to Discord as pretty embeds
- Never reposts the same announcement

## Setup (10 minutes)

### 1. Install Python stuff
```bash
pip install discord.py mysql-connector-python PyNaCl
```

### 2. Create Discord Bot
1. Go to [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
2. New Application → Name it → Create
3. Bot section → Add Bot → Copy token
4. Scroll down → Turn ON "MESSAGE CONTENT INTENT"
5. OAuth2 → URL Generator → Check `bot` → Check these permissions:
   - Send Messages
   - Embed Links  
   - View Channels
6. Copy URL → Open it → Add to your server

### 3. Setup Files
Create these 3 files in a folder:

**discord_bot.py** - Copy the bot code  
**config.json** - Your settings:
```json
{
  "discord": {
    "bot_token": "bot_token",
    "announcement_channel_id": 13323245243232,
    "ping_role_id": 123456789012345678
  },
  "database": {
    "host": "localhost",
    "port": 3306,
    "user": "your_db_user",
    "password": "your_db_password",
    "database": "your_database"
  },
  "bot": {
    "prefix": "!",
    "ping_priority_threshold": 5,
    "reactions": ["📢", "👀", "🍄", "⭐"],
    "footer_icon_url": "",
    "thumbnails": {
      "event": "",
      "update": "",
      "maintenance": "",
      "default": ""
    }
  }
}
```

**Getting Channel ID**: Discord Settings → Advanced → Developer Mode ON → Right-click channel → Copy ID

### 4. Run it
```bash
python discord_bot.py
```

Done! 🎉

## First Time? (Prevent spam)
Don't want old announcements posted? Create `last_announcement.txt` with your latest announcement ID before starting.

## Bot Commands
- `!status` - Check if bot is working
- `!test` - Test announcement (admin only)

## Troubleshooting

**Bot won't start?**
- Wrong token or channel ID
- Config.json formatting error

**No announcements posting?**
- Check database connection
- Make sure announcements have `active = 1`
- Bot needs Send Messages permission in channel

**Permission errors?**
- Re-invite bot with correct permissions
- Check bot can see the channel

## Keep it Running 24/7

**Windows**: Task Scheduler  
**Linux**: 
```bash
# Install PM2
npm install -g pm2
# Run bot
pm2 start discord_bot.py
pm2 save
pm2 startup
```
